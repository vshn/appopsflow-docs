= VSHN AppOps and AppFlow VSHNeer documentation

This repository contains all the content hosted at https://kb.vshn.ch/appopsflow/.

The content is written in https://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/[AsciiDoc] and rendered using https://docs.antora.org/[Antora].

[TIP]
====
* Writing AsciiDoc is best done using Visual Studio Code with https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=asciidoctor.asciidoctor-vscode[the AsciiDoc addon].
* For a reference what you can do with AsciiDoc, have a look at https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[AsciiDoc Writerâ€™s Guide].
* Antora is capable of doing many great things with documentation. See https://docs.antora.org/[the Antora docs] to gain insights into the tooling.

== Contributing

Create a new branch to make the changes. After you're satisfied with the changes open a Pull Request against the `master` branch.

=== Previewing Changes

To preview your changes locally, make sure you have Docker or Podman installed.

Just type `make preview` and open your browser at http://localhost:2020. This even provides support for live reload when working on the content. See https://github.com/vshn/antora-preview#livereload[this documentation] for more information about it.

=== Adding a New Page

. Create new AsciiDoc (`.adoc`) file in the best matching folder according to the described structure under `docs/modules/ROOT/pages/`.
. Add the file to the navigation under `docs/modules/ROOT/partials/`

For removing pages just do the opposite: Remove the file and remove the entry in the navigation.

== Deployment

This repository only holds https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/standard-directories/[Antora content], no plumbing and tooling (aka the Antora https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/run-antora/[`playbook.yml`] and `Dockerfile`) to build and deploy it.
All pushes to the `master` branch trigger a GitHub action (`.github/worflows/triggerci.yml`) which in turn triggers the https://git.vshn.net/vshn/docs/kb/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml[GitLab CI job] to build and deploy the content using Antora.
